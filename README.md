## Flashcards Web App

This app functions as a flashcard system: when you click on a card, it alters its state and reveals the answer to the given question. Clicking on it again toggles the component's state to revert to its default value, displaying the question anew. Clicking on another card conceals the previous card's answer and reveals the answer specific to the currently selected card.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
